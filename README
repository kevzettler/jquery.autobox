I have worked on several site designs that expect form inputs to render with a default value. Upon focus of the input the default text should clear and allow user input to stick. Sometimes the design calls for this to happen with a password field as well.

Password fields are a special condition as the text is rendered as dots. You cannot dynamically change the 'type' attribute of a password input field. This is a browser security feature. To obtain this behavior with password fields you need to dynamically create a text field on top of the password and hide it on focus. This plugin handles this
